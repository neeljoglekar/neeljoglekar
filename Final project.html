               <h3>Common cold</h3>
               <p>It's an illness caused by a tiny, infectious thing called a virus. More than 200 types lead to your misery, but the most common one is the rhinovirus, which is thought to be responsible for at least 50% of colds.
                    Other viruses that can cause colds include coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and parainfluenza.
                Colds cause a lot of people to stay home. The CDC says 22 million school days are lost each year in the U.S. because of them.
                 Some estimates say that Americans have 1 billion colds a year.

                <p>A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.
                    In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus.
                     The outbreak quickly spread around the world.COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection.
                     It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).
                     It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly.
